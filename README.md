ðŸŽ“ Project Title: E-Learning Platform UI
ðŸ“„ Description:
The E-Learning Platform UI is a multi-page front-end interface designed using pure HTML and CSS. This application simulates the layout and user experience of a real-world online learning platform, where users can browse courses, track their progress, and view embedded educational videos.

Built without any frameworks or JavaScript, this static UI focuses on clear design, intuitive layout, and responsivenessâ€”perfect for showcasing front-end design skills during my CodTech internship.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
âœ… Course Listing Page: Displays various courses with titles, descriptions, and enroll buttons in a grid layout.

âœ… Course Detail Page: Dedicated course view with a video embed area, module list, and course summary.

âœ… Progress Tracking Section: A static visual bar or badge representing course completion (UI only).

âœ… Responsive Navigation: A clean navigation bar with links to Home, Courses, About, and Contact sections.

âœ… Video Embedding: Embedded YouTube or local video player to simulate lesson content.

âœ… Fully Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack Used:
HTML5 â€“ Used to structure content into reusable sections

CSS3 â€“ Applied for layout, styling, grid systems, and responsiveness
(No JavaScript or back-end in this version)
